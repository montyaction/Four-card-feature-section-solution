### Built with

- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive

<!-- ### What I learned

I learned to use the adjacent sibling selector to make the view icon appear on hover.

```scss
.view {
  display: none;
}

.image-container:hover .overlay + .view {
  display: block;
}
``` -->
### Continued development
For future projects I need to focus on using more advanced CSS to create effects.
